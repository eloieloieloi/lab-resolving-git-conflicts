NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ---- Done By @Eloi

# Who am I

* Where are you from?
- L'esquerra de l'Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Europe, Earth. No particular preference | Order.

* What do you do?
- Good thanks, and you?

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data?
I work on the fringes of Data, and specially with Excell. I have studied C, C++ ans SQL but can't remember much of it (but the base is somewhere on my brain).

# Why am I here

* What has brought you to Ironhack?
- Good references, a will to invest economically so i feel forced to invest time/effort. Also I desire a career change. Ironhack was the best option I found for my specific set of needs.

* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?
- Programming, a refresher/improvement on statistics and specially how to apply it on a business setting.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?
- Don't know yet, but I hope something that either i enjoy more or that has a better â‚¬/time return overall.

* Which industry will you seek employment in?
- I'd only veto some of them (Oil, Real State, Meat...) But generally speaking anything would suit, as the one i studied for can't be for a while after i'd left my current position.

* What will your future role look like?
- Will depend on how I feel/evolve during the course, but I'd rather be a "botching" back-end than a "user adapting" front end. What I'm sure I won't do Sales or highly social positions, although I'd like to travel for work.

* What is your career goal?
- Something that let's me work without being too intense (phisically/emotionally) and let's me retire ASAP comfortably.
